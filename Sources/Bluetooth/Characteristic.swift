/// Representation of a Bluetooth Characteristic.
///
/// Characteristics are items of data which relate to a particular internal state.
/// Characteristics contain various parts. They have a type, a value, some properties and some permissions.
/// Properties define what another device can do with the characteristic over Bluetooth in terms of various defined operations such as READ, WRITE or NOTIFY.
/// * Reading a characteristic means transferring its current value from the attribute table to the connected device over Bluetooth.
/// * Writing allows the connected device to change that value in the state table.
/// * Notifications are a special message type which a device can send to a connected device whenever the value of the associated characteristic changes or perhaps periodically, controlled by a timer.
///
/// Not all Characteristics support all operations. The Characteristicâ€™s properties tell you which operations are supported.
